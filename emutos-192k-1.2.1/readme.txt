EmuTOS - 192 KB versions

These ROMs are suitable for the following hardware:
- ST / STf
- Mega ST
- emulators of the above

Unlike other ROM versions, they do NOT autodetect extra hardware, and might not
work on machines with additional hardware. For example, they don't work under
the Hatari emulator's Falcon emulation due to missing VIDEL support.
Also, they only work with a plain 68000 CPU.

Each ROM contains a single language:

etos192cz.img - Czech (PAL)
etos192de.img - German (PAL)
etos192es.img - Spanish (PAL)
etos192fi.img - Finnish (PAL)
etos192fr.img - French (PAL)
etos192gr.img - Greek (PAL)
etos192hu.img - Hungarian (PAL)
etos192it.img - Italian (PAL)
etos192nl.img - Dutch (PAL)
etos192no.img - Norwegian (PAL)
etos192pl.img - Polish (PAL)
etos192ru.img - Russian (PAL)
etos192se.img - Swedish (PAL)
etos192sg.img - Swiss German (PAL)
etos192tr.img - Turkish (PAL)
etos192us.img - English (NTSC)
etos192uk.img - English (PAL)

The following optional files are also supplied:
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

Note that selecting Norwegian/Swedish currently sets the language to English,
but the keyboard layout to Norwegian/Swedish.

Due to size limitations, the 192 KB ROMs contain:
- no EmuCON
- limited desktop features (comparable to Atari TOS 1)
- no builtin text file viewer and print function

These ROM images have been built using:
make all192

This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using
Vincent Rivi√®re's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in
the build process were built with native GCC 4.8.4.

The source package and other binary packages are available at:

The extras directory (if provided) contains:
(1) one or more alternate desktop icon sets, which you can use to replace
    the builtin ones.  You can use a standard resource editor to see what
    the replacement icons look like.
    To use a replacement set, move or rename the existing emuicon.rsc &
    emuicon.def files in the root directory, then copy the files containing
    the desired icons to the root, and rename them to emuicon.rsc/emuicon.def.
(2) a sample mouse cursor set in a resource (emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def).  This
    set is the same as the builtin ones, but you can use it as a basis to
    create your own mouse cursors.
    To use a replacement set, copy the files containing the desired mouse
    cursors to the root, and rename them to emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def.
